This repository contains the source code for a web-based interactive 3D simulation of the solar system. Users can explore the planets orbiting the sun while observing their relative sizes and positions.

Features:

3D Visualization: The planets and stars are rendered in a 3D environment, allowing users to rotate and zoom for a closer look.
Accurate Representation: The planets are sized and colored according to real-world data.
Orbital Paths: Elliptical paths are drawn for each planet to represent their orbital movement around the sun.
Interactive Controls: Users can navigate the scene using mouse controls for panning, rotating, and zooming.
Starfield: A background of randomly distributed stars adds depth and realism to the simulation.
Technologies Used:

HTML: Defines the structure and content of the web page.
JavaScript: Handles 3D object creation, animation, and user interaction through the Three.js library.
Getting Started:

Clone the Repository:
Bash
git clone https://github.com/ristonrodrigues723/interactive-3d-solar-system-simulation.git
Use code with caution.

Open in a Web Browser: Open the index.html file in your preferred web browser.
Usage:

Use your mouse to drag around the scene for panning.
Hold down the right mouse button and drag to rotate the view.
Use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out.
Explore the planets and their orbital paths by rotating and zooming the scene.
